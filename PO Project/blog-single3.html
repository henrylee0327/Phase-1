                    Rayquaza is a long green serpentine Pokémon with yellow eyes. It has pink lining on the mouth. It has yellow, linked, circular markings on its entire body. In Mega form, it has a Delta-shaped jaw on its mouth and an elongated serpent body. As Mega Rayquaza, it is more aggressive and powerful.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As a natural ability, Rayquaza can float and control the speed, direction and altitude of it's levitation. Despite not having used any of these characteristics in battle throughout its appearances in the anime, all the Rayquazas have very sharp claws on the hands, very sharp teeth and a very powerful constrictor body. It's not known if Mega Rayquaza can use its energy whips/tentacles as weapons or regular body members. Naturally, given it can travel through the ozone layer safely and even higher layers of Earth's atmosphere, it demands very little air to live and possibly none. If none, it could possibly travel through space, since the layer that intermediates the Ozone layer and the troposphere can hit -60 °C or -76 F. If the belief that Rayquaza is responsible for destroying meteors still in the higher atmospheric layers is true, it would have to be able to endure temperatures that can reach -100 °C, or even -148 F. It shows that Rayquaza have an great resistance to cold, which is ironic since it has double weakness to the Ice-typing. Despite its resistance, it is not known if Rayquaza can endure the -270 °C or -454 F of an absolute space vacuum.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Due to its nature of absorbing the ozone layer particles, if Rayquaza is at Alola region, it is a direct predator of Minior, should the latter Pokémon died in its core form at limited time and had its particles become one with the universe for Rayquaza to feed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rayquaza seems to be a very aggressive and territorial Pokémon, shown when it attacked a Deoxys. Yet, its aggression toward Deoxys could derive from the belief that Rayquaza is commissioned with the natural duty of shielding Earth from meteorites and similar threats, as was hinted in the Delta Episode bonus in the Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire Pokémon games.
                </p>

                  <p class="mb-0">Rayquaza does not evolve normally. Rayquaza can Mega Evolve however, after learning the move, Dragon Ascent.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    In the Hoenn region's mythology, it was said that Rayquaza stopped the fight between Groudon and Kyogre. It lives in the ozone layer far above the clouds and cannot be seen from the ground. It is noted for protecting its territory fiercely. An example of this was when a Deoxys, which had fallen from space in a meteor, appeared, Rayquaza thought that the Deoxys was invading its territory and so, attacked the Deoxys. This was in Destiny Deoxys, the 7th Pokemon movie.
