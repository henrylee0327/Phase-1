I have added some basic structure to index.html and index.css just to get the ball rolling for the index.js file. As of now there are two calls to separate APIs. One is to the pokemonapi via axios and the other is the giphy api via jQuery. As of now when you seach a pokemon by the pokemon name or index number, the name, weight, and a gif associated with that name value is returned. There is an alert set up that is triggered when anything outside the "pokemon" scope is typed in the search bar, however code needs to be written to prevent undefined values from returning gifs. Also, the ability to seach pokemon with capital letters needs to be allowed. These are a couple of things that I will continue to work on if we move forward with my code. I do apologize to the rest of the group for the structure of my code, but I tried to leave some notes. Please feel free to modify any of the code! The IDs and classes at this moment can just be placeholders.
